# 🖼️ ImageGalleryApp

A simple image gallery app built with **React Native**, **Expo Router**, and **TypeScript**.

## 🔧 Features

- List of beautiful images from dummy API
- Details screen navigation
- Clean component structure
- Built using Expo Router

## 📸 FUTURE WORK ##
✅ Design polish: Background color, shadow, rounded images, padding, and layout.

✅ Navigation polish: Go back button on details page.

✅ Fancy loader: Instead of default spinner, ek custom animation (Lottie, etc).

✅ Fade in images: Using react-native-reanimated or expo-image.

✅ Deploy to GitHub: Clean code, proper folder names, README.md.

This was my first time working on Expo Router + React Native, aur maine yeh project pura scratch pe build kiya hai-woh bhi smjh ke, har steps har error ko fix karke, bina ready-made code copy kiye. 
Abhi jada time nhi mila mujhe polish krne k liye kyuki isse phle mai react.js pe kaam kr rha tha uske projects bana rha tha 

Aage Future mai iss project aur aacha upgrade karunga aur isme kuch naya feature add karunga.
